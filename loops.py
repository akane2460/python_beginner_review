# Python Tutorial for Beginners: Episode 7, Loops

# create a list
my_list = [5, 8, 10, 12, 20, 350]

## add 5 to each element in the list using FOR loop
for element in my_list:
    element = element + 5
    print(element)

# 'If' loop
a = 1
if a % 2 == 0:
    print("a is divisible by 2")
else:
    print("a is not divisible by 2")
